This is a basic title and intro section.  We're doing this all via the
\LaTeX import directive, so you can put whatever you want here.  It
might be a good place for stating the purpose of this interference
analysis.

\newpage

Please take note of Figure \ref{fig::pfd::pfd-canonical-4kHz} vs
\ref{fig::pfd::pfd-expected-4kHz}.  The reason you see just a stark
difference between the 'Peak' and 'Expected' is that the assumed ACM
in PyLink automatically adjusts to the appropriate modcode and selects
it based upon the transmit efficiency, rather than the receive
efficiency.  Because rolloff may affect the transmitters ability to
operate legally next to a sensitive band (cough DSN cough), the
transmit spectral efficiency and the receive spectral efficiency are
separated.

To avoid regulatory issues, it may be advisable to utilize less BW
than is allocated, whereas the canonical figure (Figure
\ref{fig::pfd::pfd-canonical-4kHz}) assumes full use of the entire
allocation.  As a consequence, the PFD in the expected case is
actually higher, because the utilized bandwidth is actually lower,
because it isn't safe to use the entire bandwidth.
