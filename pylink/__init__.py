"""Link Budget Management in Python

This package provides a flexible system with which to build and solve
any Directed Acyclic Graph data model.  The design objective is to
hide the complexity of calculation in discrete segments all registered
through a simple central interface.  See the package README for more
details, the examples directory in the source code for how to use it.

IGNORE THE 'PACKAGE CONTENTS'.  Python is annoying, here's what you
can look up if you're interested:

=== Tributaries ===
Antenna
LinkBudget
Channel
Geometry
Interconnect
Code
Modulation
Receiver
Transmitter

=== Other Objects ===
Element
DAGModel
LoopException
BitrateFigure
CanonicalPFDFigure
ExpectedPFDFigure
PFDvsBWFigure
BitrateFigure
Report
TaggedAttribute

=== Utility Functions ===
to_db
from_db
spreading_loss_db
pattern_generator
rx_pfd_hz_adjust
tx_pfd_hz_adjust
e_field_to_eirp_dbw
eirp_dbw_to_e_field_v_per_m
